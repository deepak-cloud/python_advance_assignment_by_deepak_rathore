    "If a class contains one or more abstract methods, it is termed an Abstract class. The term \"abstract method\" refers to a method that has been declared but does not have any implementation. It is not possible to instantiate abstract classes, and their abstract methods must be implemented by their subclasses."

    "# Q4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method ?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "What we really want to do here is somehow augment the original giveRaise, instead of replacing it altogether. The good way to do that in Python is by calling to the original version directly, with augmented arguments, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Manager(Person):\n",

    "\n",
    "Person.giveRaise(self, percent + bonus) # Good: augment original\n",
    "\n",
    "This code leverages the fact that a class method can always be called either through an instance (the usual way, where Python sends the instance to the self argument automatically) or through the class (the less common scheme, where you must pass the instance manually). In more symbolic terms, recall that a normal method call of this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "instance.method(args...) is automatically translated by Python into this equivalent form:\n",
    "\n",
    "class.method(instance, args...)\n",
    "\n",
    "where the class containing the method to be run is determined by the inheritance search rule applied to the method's name. You can code either form in your script, but there is a slight asymmetry between the two—you must remember to pass along the instance manually if you call through the class directly. The method always needs a subject instance one way or another, and Python provides it automatically only for calls made through an instance. For calls through the class name, you need to send an instance to self yourself; for code inside a method like giveRaise, self already is the subject of the call, and hence the instance to pass along.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling through the class directly effectively subverts inheritance and kicks the call higher up the class tree to run a specific version. In our case, we can use this technique to invoke the default giveRaise in Person, even though it's been redefined at the Manager level. In some sense, we must call through Person this way, because a self.giveRaise() inside Manager's giveRaise code would loop—since self already is a Manager, self.giveRaise() would resolve again to Manager.giveRaise, and so on and so forth until available memory is exhausted.\n",
