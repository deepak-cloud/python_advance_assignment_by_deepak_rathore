    "## Solution:\n",
    "OOPs is a programming technique in Python that emphasises the use of objects and classes in the same way that other generic programming languages do. Any real-world entities can be used as objects. Python lets programmers to create programmes utilising the OOPs method, with a strong emphasis on code reuse. In Python, creating classes and objects is a simple."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is qualified in Python, inheritance occurs, and it requires exploring an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Python scans the namespace tree at and above object for the first attr it can find whenever you use an expression of the form object.attr, where object is an instance or class object. Inheritance is the foundation of specialisation since lower definitions in the tree overrule higher ones."

    "Class variables are for properties and methods that are shared by all instances of the class, whereas instance variables are for data that is unique to each instance. Class variables are variables whose value is assigned in the class, but instance variables are variables whose value is assigned inside a constructor or method using self.\n"

    "The procedure of calling is automated, but the procedure of receiving is not (its explicit).\n",
    "This is why the object itself must be the first parameter of a class function. It's just a habit to write this parameter as self. It is not a keyword in Python and has no particular significance."
